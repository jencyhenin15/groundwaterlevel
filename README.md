# Groundwater Level Predictor
used to predict groundwater level for forthcoming years

Ground Water Level analyzer and Predictor. IoT and Machine Learning is used to measure the value and predict the level with high accuracy . Using water level measuring sensors, the level of ground water is measured and the data is sent over the server. The data is stored in the cloud and a copy of it is sent to the main system. The received data is processed by the ML program to predict the water level in the future. The code also tells the difference between the water level from the past year's value. From the result, we can predict the water level in the upcoming years and plan a perfect solution for it. It helps us in recharging Groundwater level and helps the community to resilience easily.
