# Groundwater Level Predictor
used to predict groundwater level for forthcoming years

Groundwater is the main source of drinking water and the source of nourishment for trees and lakes. Decrease in groundwater level of an area can have adverse effects such as drought, saline water intrusion and makes the land unsuitable for agriculture, thus it is necessary to prevent the ground water from getting depleted. In recent years many places have been affected by decreased water levels. Hence there is a need to predict the forthcoming level of water to plan effectively
